This repo shows the integration of langgraph with langsmith for debugging along with Google Gemini LLM

LangGraph Node.js
A robust Node.js implementation of LangGraph, designed for building stateful, multi-agent applications and complex LLM workflows. This project provides a foundational structure for orchestrating AI agents, managing conversational state, and creating dynamic, decision-making pipelines entirely within the Node.js ecosystem.

Features
Stateful Agent Orchestration: Leverage LangGraph's capabilities to manage complex conversational flows and agent interactions with persistent state.

Node.js Integration: Build high-performance, scalable LLM applications using familiar JavaScript/TypeScript syntax and the extensive Node.js ecosystem.

Modular Design: Organized project structure promoting reusability and maintainability of agents, tools, and graph definitions.

Dynamic Decision Making: Implement conditional routing and advanced logic within your LLM workflows.

Extensible: Easily integrate with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and custom tools.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm or yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shdhumale/langgraph-node-js.git
cd langgraph-node-js

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Configuration
This project likely relies on API keys for LLM providers. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

# Example for OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Example for other providers (if used)
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Any other specific configuration variables for your application
# e.g., DATABASE_URL=...

Note: Ensure you replace your_openai_api_key_here and other placeholders with your actual API keys. Do not commit your .env file to version control.

Usage
To start the application, run the following command:

npm start
# or
node src/index.js
# or (if using a build step)
npm run build && npm start

Once the application is running, you can interact with it based on its specific implementation (e.g., via an API endpoint, a command-line interface, or a web UI). Refer to the src/index.js or example files for specific entry points and interaction methods.

Project Structure
A typical langgraph-node-js project might have the following structure:

langgraph-node-js/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/            # Defines individual LLM agents and their capabilities
│   │   ├── assistantAgent.js
│   │   └── userProxyAgent.js
│   ├── tools/             # Contains custom tools that agents can use (e.g., search, API calls)
│   │   ├── searchTool.js
│   │   └── calculatorTool.js
│   ├── graphs/            # Defines the LangGraph state and graph structure
│   │   ├── conversationalGraph.js
│   │   └── researchGraph.js
│   ├── config/            # Configuration files (e.g., LLM model settings)
│   ├── utils/             # Helper functions
│   └── index.js           # Main application entry point, initializes the graph
├── .env.example           # Example environment variables file
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore file
├── package.json           # Node.js project dependencies and scripts
├── README.md              # This file

src/agents/: Modules defining the behavior and roles of different agents within your LangGraph application.

src/tools/: Reusable functions or classes that agents can invoke to perform specific actions (e.g., fetching data, calculations).

src/graphs/: The core of your LangGraph definition, including state schemas, nodes, edges, and compilation logic.

src/index.js: The main file where the LangGraph is instantiated and run, possibly exposing an API or CLI.
