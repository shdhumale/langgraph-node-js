langgraph-node-js
This repository demonstrates the integration of LangGraph with LangSmith for debugging, leveraging the Google Gemini LLM within a Node.js environment. It provides a foundational structure for orchestrating AI agents, managing conversational state, and creating dynamic, decision-making pipelines.

üåü Features
Stateful Agent Orchestration: Build and manage complex conversational flows with stateful agents using LangGraph.

Node.js Integration: Seamlessly integrate powerful AI orchestration capabilities into your Node.js applications.

LangSmith Debugging: Utilize LangSmith for comprehensive tracing, monitoring, and debugging of your LangGraph applications, offering deep insights into agent interactions.

Google Gemini LLM: Leverage the advanced capabilities of Google Gemini for natural language understanding and generation within your AI agents.

Modular Design: A well-structured project that allows for easy extension and customization of agents, tools, and graphs.

Dynamic Decision-Making: Create pipelines where agents can dynamically decide on the next action based on the current state and LLM outputs.

Extensibility: Designed to be easily extended with new agents, tools, and LLMs.

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_langsmith_project_name

Google API Key: Obtain this from the Google Cloud Console or Google AI Studio.

LangSmith API Key: Obtain this from your LangSmith dashboard.

Usage
Run the application:

node index.js

(Replace index.js with your main application file if it's different).
